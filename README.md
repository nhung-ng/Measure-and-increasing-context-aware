# Measure-and-increasing-context-aware

Introduce a new metric, conditional cross-mutual information, to quantify the usage of context by English-Vietnamese machine translation systems. Then introduce a new, simple training method, context-aware word dropout, to increase the usage of context. Experiments show that our method increases context usage and that this reflects on the translation quality according to metrics such as BLEU.
